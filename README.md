The outline effect is achieved in the following way: selected objects are first rendered into a texture.<br>
Then, the edges of objects on this texture are drawn over the main texture.<br>
Optionally, the outline can be drawn in a separate texture and then used through a shader.<br>

```
Basically, all you need to do is add `OutlineFxFeature` to the Urp Renderer<br>
and `OutlineFx` script to the object you want to outline.<br>

That's it, the outline settings are common for all objects,<br>
you can also customize the outline shape, fill and its texture.

The texture source can also be output to a global texture <br>
and used manually via a shader or processed with [VolFx](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx)
